Firewatch Community Localization Project
==============================

Thanks for your interest in making Firewatch more accessible for people around the world! As a small team of developers, we’re unable to offer complete translations of our game into all the languages people have asked us for… which is where the amazing fan community comes in.

We're making available our full text-string database for this purpose. We invite you to localize these, test them out, and contribute them back to this repository for others to use. Work contributed back must include the MIT license, found below.

Where to find the data
-----------
Here on our Github page, you’ll find complete text dumps of every string in the game— from menu choices, to spoken dialog captions, to UI and note text. All of this is present in a series of named files in a simple JSON format using Unicode (UTF-8) encoding. We recommend editing a text editor that understands JSON and Unicode such as Sublime Text.

You can download the entire repository as a Zip file.


Licensing
-----------

All English game content provided here is Copyright 2016, Campo Santo, all rights reserved. It is, howver, free for you to use in creating a localized copy. A localized copy is defined as a complete, line-for-line translation of the English text provided into another language.

By contributing new localizations back to the community, you're agreeing to license them to Campo Santo and to all fans of Firewatch to use and modify (see below).


Community Localization licensing

All community-contributed localizations MUST be licensed under the Creative Commons "BY-NC 4.0" License, available here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/

Others players are free to access, play, and remix your localization strings so long as they, too, contribute them back to this repository free of charge. In this way, people will be able to improve upon the work of others and offer the widest variety of high-quality translations of this game.
